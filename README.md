There was a great deal of research done to complete this project. Part of that research was reading through the documentation for MySQL. I also read through materials and articles from StackOverflow, and class resources provided by the bootcamp. I also recieved assistance from my TA instructors during office hours when I ran into an issue. In addition, I conferred with my classmates and colleagues, as well as Andrew Zimmerman.
